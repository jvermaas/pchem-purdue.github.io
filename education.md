***Instructor***
Hanzhe Liu [email](mailto:hanzhe@purdue.edu)

***Syllabus***
This is an introductory course aiming to provide chemistry students with basic understanding of concepts, applications, and mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics. The goal of the course is two-fold: to provide sufficient mathematical background for the students interested in advanced quantum mechanics and spectroscopy courses, and to broaden conceptual understanding of QM and discuss a variety of chemically-relevant examples and models to those not planning to delve deeper into the quantum world. Some of the assignments will be based on Python programming which will be introduced in the course. An undergraduate course in Physical Chemistry is a formal prerequisite but students with various backgrounds are welcome.

Topics covered:
- Historical background and modern interpretation of QM
- Main concepts: wave function and Schrodinger equation
- Case studies: particle in a box, harmonic oscillator, finite well, Hydrogen atom
- Spin and angular momentum; many-particle systems
- Tools of QM: perturbation theory and variational principle
- QM and chemistry: understanding atoms, molecules, and solids

***Textbooks and Resources***
- Required:
  - D. Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 2nd or 3rd edition

Topics covered:
1.	Review: the basis postulates of quantum mechanics
2.	Identical particles and second quantization
3.	Hartee-Fock approximation
4.	Ideal quantum gases

***Instructor***
Lyudmila Slipchenko [email](mailto:lslipchenko@purdue.edu)

***Syllabus***
This course aims to give the students both theoretical and practical background in the computational techniques used in modern quantum chemistry. A significant fraction of the students' time will be spent actually using quantum chemistry programs.

A solid undergraduate background in Physical Chemistry or, preferably, Quantum Mechanics, will suffice as a prerequisite.

Topics covered:
1. Schrodinger equation. Review of QM. Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
2. Chemical reactions and potential energy surfaces.
3. Orbitals and Slater determinants. Theoretical model chemistries.
4. Hartree-Fock theory. Koopmans’ theorem.
5. Basis sets.
6. Molecular orbitals. Point group symmetry.
7. Spin operators. Restricted and unrestricted HF.
8. Density functional theory.
9. Electron correlation. Configuration interaction. Size-consistency problem. Wave function versus electron density approaches.
10. Dynamical correlation. Second-order perturbation theory. Coupled cluster theory. Extrapolation techniques. Performance of electronic structure methods.
11. Non-dynamical correlation. Multi-configuration SCF.
12. Electronic excited states. CIS, TD-DFT, EOM-CCSD
13. Chemistry of extended and periodic systems: solvation models, QM/MM,
fragmentation methods
